# Snake-Game


A snake game created using js , css and HTML without using canvas . The length of the snake increases everytime the snake eats the food and the timer increases by 5 seconds . Three lives are initially given and a life is lost when the snake collides with the wall or itself . The game is over when the timer runs out. I have also included a pause button to the game.
